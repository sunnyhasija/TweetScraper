# TweetScraper
The keywordscraper.py file allows you to download tweets containing a particular keyword from the public twitter stream.

The profilescraper.py file allows you to download tweets from any public twitter profile. It paginates through the profile to download all tweets (actually 3200, most the twitter API allows) from that profile.
